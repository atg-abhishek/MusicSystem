MusicSystem
===========
Aiming to make a music system from scratch using some of the new 
languages that I am learning - yet to decide on what will be used and 
how it will be structured ... more of a placeholder at the moment till 
my mind is made up 

Just fixed my problem with the system where it kept asking me to enter 
my username and password again and again - thanks to Stack Overflow for 
the solution

The day was spent trying to understand how MIDI interprets musical notes as compared 
to the way music is composed in real life, also having a few struggles understanding 
the concept of channels in the context of MIDI

The progress on the development has been slow due to several issues that I've been encountering in terms of making the DL class work in the current environment. 
There are several methods and functionalities that have either be changed in their implementations or have subtle variations and I'm trying to callibrate that to get the results that I 
want. 

I am still stuck with the DL Importer issue that I have been trying to 
troubleshoot, there are not enough examples of the new version that is 
used now, so will continue looking into it.
